What is BioLib?
---------------

BioLib is a bioinformatics library written in Ruby created from solving Rosalind.info problems.

I decided to solve the problems on Rosalind and put all my solutions in library form in case the solutions were useful outside of Rosalind. 

A basic set of unit tests exist in the tests test directory which also serves as examples on how to use the APIs.
